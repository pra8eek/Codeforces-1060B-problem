# Codeforces-1060B-problem
The simple non greedy approach to the problem, but the complexity is not optimized.
Try to implement the above C++ code using the appropriate Greedy Algorithm.
Lower order complexity can be obtained using more increment in the for loop or through the higher initialised value of i i.e we can initialse i from more near values to i/2.
###### Worst case here is n = 10000000000. Ans = 90 here.
###### Time per test case < 2 sec.
